# 2DPlatformer
Simple 2D platformer made in Unity with Standard Assets back in high school. Currently implemented: Multiple levels, lives, jumping and movement, respawning, checkpoints. This serves as an archive of my **code** only, NOT the built game.

Known issues: Falling from a great height may get you stuck in a block and unable to move. This was an engine issue, and typically occurs about eight levels in. You may get lucky and not experience it!

To download a playable build of the game, retrieve the download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoWaS_d1jJbBHetWpxYe-ngrRv9cvWdv/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, it is available on my website for download at [kevincbopp.com](https://www.kevincbopp.com).
